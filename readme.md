Hi Darius, 

Thank you for letting me do this project. If anything, I learned a lot, and I got to practice more!

I know that I didn't use VUE.JS, and I definitely agree that it would have made this project easier and condensed the code a lot. I spent about 10 hours learning about VUE on Monday in order to do this, but I kept running in to the same problem of how to push the API to each DIV/card without repeating the last dog that was fetched from the API. Here is what I was trying to do:

in Javascript:
export default AND mounted() OR async created()- both of these came up a lot so it looked like the correct code. 

From there, I would have put {{dog}} in HTML where I wanted the function to go, hopefully pulling the API in to that. 

I just wanted to show you that I did in fact attempt to learn VUE, but without anyone who actually knows VUE that I could ask, this was more difficult.

If you do decide to hire me, I look forward to being able to work with someone who can actually use VUE and can teach me better than videos online can. And if not, I have still learned some valuable skills along the way, so thank you!

In all, throughout these few days with a wedding out of town and getting sick with the flu, I still managed to get this done. I hope that shows you what kind of employee I would be if hired. 

Best,
Allie Porter
